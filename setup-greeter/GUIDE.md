# Setup and Greeter

Assuming you followed along and have all the dependencies,

You are given 3 folders, and a file `truffle.js`
- `/contracts`
- `/migrations`
- `/test`
This is a result of running `truffle init` in the console. Usually, you would do this to start a project but we have done this for you.

Write the Greeter contract as a starter exercise. Remember the Greeter contract does the following:
- Has a constructor, which accepts one `string _greeting` argument
- Set a Greeting (only in the constructor!)
- Has a variable `string greeting`
- Has a Greet function, which returns the `string greeting`

#### To check your solution run `truffle test`.
There is only 1 test you need to pass to continue.
